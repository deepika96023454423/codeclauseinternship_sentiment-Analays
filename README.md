# Sentiment-Analaysis
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
# Technologies Used
For sentiment analysis, we utilize the Python Sentiment Analysis Library. This library provides pre-trained models and tools for analyzing sentiment in text data.
# Usage
Navigate to the Project Directory, Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned the sentiment analysis project.Start the sentiment analysis tool by running the main script.The program will prompt you to input text for sentiment analysis. Type or paste the text you want to analyze and press Enter.View Sentiment Analysis Results, The program will analyze the sentiment of the input text and display the result, indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
# Project structure
The project directory is structured as follows: sentiment Analysis.py: Main script to execute the sentiment Analysis tool. README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guide, etc.
